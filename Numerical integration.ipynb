    "The `interact` function is a new iPython feature, and is still under development.  If you move the sliders there is a latency (delay) before the desired plot is shown, and some of the intermediate slider positions are briefly displayed.  This is a problem with the implementation of the `interact` function.  However, latency will always be a serious problem whenever the function to be evaluated (in our case, `V(x,y,z,R,Q)`) is complicated.  Ours is a simple integral, but if it were very complicated, it might take several seconds (or longer) to complete.  An interactive environment is less useful in situations like that."
