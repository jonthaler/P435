    "* Two charges, nominally $q_1 = 1$ and $q_2 = -0.4$, but values and positions are adjustable.\n‚Äù,
    "* For clarity, I omit the ubiquitous factor of $\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$. \n",
    "* Plot the field lines and equipotentials.\n",
    "* Suggested exercise: Assuming that $q_+ \\gt \\lvert{q_-}\\rvert$, verify that the fraction (fractional solid angle) of  $q_+$'s field lines that end on $q_-$ is $\\lvert{q_-}\\rvert/q_+$.  You'll have to estimate the angle, $\\theta$, that separates the field lines ending on $q_-$ from those that go to infinity, then integrate the solid angle from $0$ to $\\theta$ angle.  Don't forget the factor of $\\sin(\\theta)$ in the solid angle.  Alternatively, you can calculate the angle and graph lines (on the field line plot) that have the calculated slopes ($\\pm\\tan(\\theta)$)."
